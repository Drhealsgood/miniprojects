        <p>A bunch of mini-projects inspired from <a href="https://github.com/thekarangoel">thekarangoel</a></p>

<p>A few have been completed to a more abstract sense of the question. I may be 100% explicit in answering at some stage or might end up just leaving the problems in functions/classes to be called from main.</p>

<a name="project-euler" class="anchor" href="#project-euler"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Euler</h1>

<p>Also attempting <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems along the way because some of the problems overlap; project euler problems are fun and challenging, and just because.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you fork this repo to solve these projects in any language of your choice, please remove all my code, and start from scratch; you'll benefit a lot. Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> send pull requests.</p>
